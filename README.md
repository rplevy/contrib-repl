# contrib-repl

nREPL middleware to look up the latest versions of all Clojure contrib libraries
and add them as dependencies. Can also be used manually in an already-running
REPL.

## Usage

###Option A. Use as middleware:

```clojure
  :dependencies [[contrib-repl "0.0.1"]]
  :repl-options {:nrepl-middleware [contrib-repl.middleware/add-contrib-deps]}
```

###Option B. Invoke from an already running REPL:

```clojure
(require '[cemerick.pomegranate :as pom])
(pom/add-dependencies :coordinates '[[contrib-repl "0.0.1"]]
                      :repositories {"clojars" "http://clojars.org/repo"})
(require '[contrib-repl.manually :refer [add-contrib-deps]])

(add-contrib-deps ["tools.nrepl" "core.match"]) ; only add these libraries
(add-contrib-deps) ; add all of the contrib libraries
```
